tsoha 2020


Application for users to create their own island and select 10 Animal Crossing characters for their island.

Only admin can create and edit characters. User can select and change characters only for their own island.

Characters have: name (unique), birthday (month and day), species and personality.
Personalities: Normal, Peppy, Snooty, Sisterly, Lazy, Cranky, Jock, Smug

There are also clothes, which users can give to animals on their island. Each animal has specific default clothes which they wear if the user does not change them. Each animal can only wear one outfit, but the same outfit can be given to multiple animals. If the same animal is on multiple islands, they can have different clothes on different islands, so users cannot change animals' clothes on other islands.

Users can see the list of charactes and filter it by species and/or personality. Lists can be arranged alphabetically or by birthday.
Users can see for which islands each character is selected to. Several users can select the same character for their island.
